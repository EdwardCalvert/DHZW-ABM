 * The definition of a communicative act belonging to the <b>Communicative Act
 * Library</b> (CAL) is normative. That is, if a given agent implements one of
 * the acts in the CAL, then it must implement that act in accordance with the
 * semantic definition in the CAL. However, FIPA- compliant agents are not
 * required to implement any of the CAL languages, except the not-understood
 * composite act.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By collecting communicative act definitions in a single, publicly accessible
 * registry, the CAL facilitates the use of standardized communicative acts by
 * agents developed in different contexts. It also provides a greater incentive
 * to developers to make any privately developed communicative acts generally
 * available.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The name assigned to a proposed communicative act must uniquely identify
 * which communicative act is used within a FIPA ACL message. It must not
 * conflict with any names currently in the library, and must be an English word
 * or abbreviation that is suggestive of the semantics.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * FIPA is responsible for maintaining a consistent list of approved and
 * proposed communicative act names and for making this list publicly available
 * to FIPA members and non-members. This list is derived from the FIPA CAL.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In addition to the semantic characterization and descriptive information that
 * is required, each communicative act in the CAL may specify additional
 * information, such as stability information, versioning, contact information,
 * different support levels, etc.

	 * <h1>The sender intends that the receiver treat the embedded message as sent
	 * directly to the receiver, and wants the receiver to identify the agents
	 * denoted by the given descriptor and send the received propagate message to
	 * them.</h1>
	 * <p>
	 * This is a compound action of the following two actions:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>The sending agent requests the recipient to treat the embedded message in
	 * the received propagate message as if it is directly sent from the sender,
	 * that is, as if the sender performed the embedded communicative act directly
	 * to the receiver.</li>
	 * <li>The sender wants the receiver to identify agents denoted by the given
	 * descriptor and to send a modified version of the received propagate message
	 * to them, as described below.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * On forwarding, the receiver parameter of the forwarded propagate message is
	 * set to the denoted agent(s) and the sender parameter is set to the receiver
	 * of the received propagate message. The sender and receiver of the embedded
	 * communicative act of the forwarded propagate message is also set to the same
	 * agent as the forwarded propagate message’s sender and receiver, respectively.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * This communicative act is designed for delivering messages through federated
	 * agents by creating a chain (or tree) of propagate messages. An example of
	 * this is instantaneous brokerage requests using a proxy message, or persistent
	 * requests by a requestwhen/request-whenever message embedding a proxy message.
